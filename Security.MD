# Your Safety & Security with LUMINET

I'd like to start this off by saying please do **your own due diligence**, research about WireGuard, research about the company **[sshs8](https://sshs8.com)** (The service/company/website that provides the servers & that allows us to make this VPN automated & working).

We are **NOT** responsible for any damages, any attacks, anything illegal or unethical that may occur when using LUMINET. We have done our part of the service, which is making LUMINET functional & use-able. Whether it may or may not actually be safe for use is not something we can decide.

The servers created on **[sshs8](https://sshs8.com)** can only be accessed by **you** (as long as you do not share the information of the server (e.g. IP, Port, Password, Username, etc)), as you are the only person with the .config file that is needed in order to connect to the server created. In general, you are safe and no one will be able to view your activity *except* **[sshs8](https://sshs8.com)** if they will to do so.

It is important to note that no company in this world would EVER give away free private networks, so there's definitely a catch somewhere.
Do your own due diligence, research, and enjoy.
