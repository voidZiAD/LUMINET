# ðŸ¤” Why can't LUMINET connect yet?

LUMINET uses the WireGuard protocol, which is relatively new to the cybersecurity programming world (at least for C# apparently), and so far I've been trying to figure out a solution on how I can access WireGuard's command-line or create a WireGuard client in order to allow LUMINET users to ACTUALLY CONNECT to the Virtual Private Networks which is the whole point of the VPN, however I've been facing issues with finding any Library or solution to the problem. I definitely will not be switching from WireGuard, but I may implement other protocols in the future in case this is taking too long. 

## How can you help with this issue?

If you are a C# Programmer, and you are familiar with WireGuard & how it works, I'd greatly appreciate if you forked the project, implemented WireGuard into the app, and requested a merge. I am actively looking for solutions on how to implement it, but it would be great if you could help. Thanks for understanding.
